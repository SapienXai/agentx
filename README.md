## üöÄ Getting Started

Get the BrowserX Agent running on your machine in a few simple steps.

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18 or later is recommended).

### 2. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal, navigate to where you want to store the project, and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SapienXai/agentx.git
cd agentx
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

This single command installs all necessary packages and also triggers Playwright to download the required browser binaries for automation.

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up API Keys

The agent relies on a few powerful services for its intelligence, search, and scraping capabilities.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory. You can do this by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

(If `.env.example` doesn't exist, just create a new file named `.env`)

Edit the `.env` file and add your API keys. It should look like this:

```ini
# .env

# Required for planning and decision-making
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Required for advanced web search
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...

# Required for reliable web scraping
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...
```

**How to Get Your API Keys:**

- **üîë OpenAI**: Required for the agent's core intelligence.
  - Get your key: [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  - Note: You'll need to have some credits on your OpenAI account. New accounts often come with free trial credits.

- **üîë Tavily AI**: The agent's specialized search tool. It's much more effective for AI agents than a standard Google search.
  - Get your key: [app.tavily.com](https://app.tavily.com)
  - Note: Tavily offers a generous free tier with 1,000 API calls per month.

- **üîë Firecrawl**: The agent's web scraping tool, for instantly turning websites into clean, usable data.
  - Get your key: [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
  - Note: Firecrawl also has a free tier that is sufficient for most use cases.

**Important**: The application will not start without these API keys.

### 5. Run the Application

You're all set! Start the agent with:

```bash
npm start
```

The Electron application window will open, and you can start giving the agent tasks.

## üí° How It Works

The agent operates on a sophisticated loop that combines high-level planning with intelligent, tool-based execution. This "tool-first" approach makes it faster and more reliable than agents that rely solely on visual analysis.

</p>

### Goal Input & Planning:

- The user provides a high-level goal (e.g., "Find the top 3 AI news headlines from Google News and summarize them").
- The `createPlan` function sends this goal to GPT-4o, which returns a structured JSON plan, including a task summary, a target URL, recurring schedule information (if any), and a step-by-step plan.
- **User Approval**: The generated plan is displayed in the UI for user confirmation.

### Autonomous Execution Loop (`runAutonomousAgent`):

- Once approved, the agent starts its execution loop. The core logic is handled by the `decideNextAction` function.
- **Tool Selection**: For each step, `decideNextAction` analyzes the goal, plan, and previous action results to choose the best tool for the job.
  - If the task is to search the web, it uses the `tavily_search` tool.
  - If the task is to scrape a specific URL, it uses the `firecrawl_scrape` tool.
  - Only if direct visual interaction is required (e.g., logging in, clicking a button without a clear API), it falls back to using Playwright to control a browser.
- **Action Execution**: The chosen action (e.g., `tavily_search`, `click`, `type`, `finish`) is executed.
- **Feedback & Iteration**: The result of the action (e.g., search results, scraped content, or an error message) is fed back into the `decideNextAction` function for the next iteration. This allows the agent to self-correct. For example, if a `firecrawl_scrape` fails on one URL, it will try a different URL from the last search result.
- **Completion**: The loop continues until the `finish` action is called with a final summary, the agent is stopped by the user, or it reaches the maximum step limit.

## üìñ Usage Guide

1. **Launch the Application**:
   - Run `npm start` to open the Electron app.
2. **Enter a Goal**:
   - In the UI, type a natural language goal (e.g., "Summarize the latest AI research papers from arXiv").
3. **Review the Plan**:
   - The agent will generate a step-by-step plan for approval.
4. **Execute the Task**:
   - Approve the plan, and the agent will autonomously execute it, using the appropriate tools.
5. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Watch the agent's progress in the UI, with logs and results displayed in real-time.
6. **Stop or Adjust**:
   - Pause or stop the agent at any time, or modify the goal to start a new task.
